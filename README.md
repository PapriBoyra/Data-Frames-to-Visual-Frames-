# Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the foundational understanding of data visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas. It covers key concepts such as plotting various chart types (line, bar, scatter plots), customizing visualizations with labels, titles, and legends, and handling multiple datasets to generate meaningful insights.

## Datasets Used
1. **Heart Disease Dataset**  
   Data related to heart disease diagnoses.

2. **Buffet Details Dataset**  
   A dataset containing extended details of a buffet.

3. **Air Passengers Dataset**  
   Data of air passenger counts over a period of time.

4. **Churn Data**  
   Customer churn information.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (e.g., line, bar, scatter plots).
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing datasets for visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting various charts using Matplotlib, such as line, bar, and scatter plots.
- **Customization**: Customizing charts with labels, titles, legends, and gridlines.
- **Multiple Dataset Handling**: Managing and visualizing data from different sources.
